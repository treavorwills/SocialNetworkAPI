## Description
This is a social media NoSQL backend API. This project is built on MongoDB with routing handled by Express.js. 
User information like username and email address are stored as well as friendships with other users. Users can post their own thoughts and add reactions to other users' thoughts.

My motivation in completing this was to get familiar with non-tabular databases. It was an excellent exercise to prepare me to build full-stack, MERN applications with functional front ends. 

Since this exercise did not include a front end, all the routes were tested in Insomnia. A couple of screenshots are included below as well as a video demonstrating various CRUD operations.
